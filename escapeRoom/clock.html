            <h1>Behind the Clock</h1>
            <div class=room>
                <p> You look behind one clock, but there is nothing there. You look behind the other clock, and there is a case with a UDLR lock. You notice that the clocks aren't moving. One is at 12:15, and the other is at 6:00.</p>
                <p>What is the combination?</p>
                <p>Answer format: UDLR</p>
                <input type="text" id="udlrLock">
                <button id = "submit">SUBMIT</button>
            </div>
            <script>
                var udlr = document.getElementById("udlrLock").value;
                var answer = document.getElementById("submit");
                
                udlr.addEventListener("click", clockClue);
                
                if(udlr = URDU && ){
                    
                }
            </script>
